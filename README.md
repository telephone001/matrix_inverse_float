# matrix_inverse_float
calculates the inverse of a float matrix using LU decomposition and pivoting
Warning: doesn't check if the matrix is inverseable. It will try to inverse an uninverseable matrix and kill your program

I made this to inverse a matrix to find the positions of masses in a mechanical system represented by a state space matrix, but I forgot a crucial detail of the state space representation and now I have this

you can have it
